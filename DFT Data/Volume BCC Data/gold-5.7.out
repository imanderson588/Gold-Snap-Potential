     one-electron contribution =      81.46529737 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      12.04593619 Ry
     xc contribution           =     -70.89913860 Ry
     ewald contribution        =    -171.53135920 Ry
     one-center paw contrib.   =   -1386.97753739 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  22 iterations
